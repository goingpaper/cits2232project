The Brass Monkey is a Perth icon and the most photographed hotel in WA. Youâ€™ll understand why when you see it lit up at night, beckoning hungry and thirsty pedestrians to wander in.

Mojos Bar loves live original music seventeen days a week. It loves it local and foreign, hard and soft, new and old, obvious and obscure, friendly and furious... you get the idea.

This is really what our little bar is all about, being able to come down without worrying about bookings and door lists, gather some friends and sharing some tasty food and trying new drinks in a comfortable space.
